    "# Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervised learning is a machine learning technique which the model is trained with a labeled dataset, meaning the data includes both inputs and the desired outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- The predicted values are knwown\n",
    "- Supervised learning uses labels\n",
    "- Aim: Predict the target values of unseen data, given the features\n",

    "## Types of supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervised learning is divided mainly into two types of supervised learning, classification and regression\n",

    "### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "They are used to predict discrete / categorical outcomes (y) using independent variables (x)\n",

    "1. Build a classifier model\n",
